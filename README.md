# Welcome to my Project 3 page

## Project 3 consisted of:
- Creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.
- p3-module.js : Code module that exports the coinage functionality
- p3-server.js: Coinage web server 
index.html : Main coin testing web page that issues requests to the web server
package.json : Node.js configuration file
.gitignore : Git intentional file ignore file

## What I learned:
- Gained experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gained experience breaking a project into manageable components
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practiced creating and using code modules
- Practiced refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gained experience writing and executing web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Gained experience using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters
- Gained experience loading a file and using as a web page
